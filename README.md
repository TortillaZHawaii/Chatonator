Repo for testing Semantic Kernel C#.

Connectors.AI.Ollama is a simple library that provides a way to use free Ollama services instead of paid OpenAI services.
Ollama must be run before running the demo by using the following command:
```bash
ollama serve
```

I am using `mistral:7b` model for the demo. The model must be installed before running the demo by using the following command:
```bash
ollama pull mistral:7b
```
